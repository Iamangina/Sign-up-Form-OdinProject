Sign-Up Form â€“ The Odin Project

This is an initial desktop-only version of the project.  
Mobile responsiveness and cross-device support are not yet implemented.

This is a responsive sign-up form built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It features a layout with a form section and a background image section. The form includes fields for first name, last name, email, phone number, password, and password confirmation. Password visibility can be toggled with a button. The design focuses on accessibility, responsive styling, and form validation using HTML5 and CSS.
